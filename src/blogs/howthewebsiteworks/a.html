                It's simple really: a bunch of html files are processed with M4 macros and published to github pages! What, you want more detail? Fine.<br>
                <br>

                This article is intended for a general audience. <br>
                <h2 class="sub-header">Step one: Hosting</h2><br>
                There are a million ways to host a website. Things like Wix and Squarespace exist as a combination of easy-to-use website builder and host.
                They provide all kinds of useful functionality, such as templates, themes, paid content, etc. I did not use one of those, for a few reasons:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>They often require payment</li>
                    <li>If they vanish for some reason, my website vanishes with it</li>
                    <li>Perhaps most importantly, It's more fun to do it manually anyway</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Instead, I use a simple static website hosting service: Github Pages. Github Pages is mainly for software projects to host their own basic website,
                but nothing is stopping anyone from hosting a website with whatever content they want. There isn't any control over the server-side - so 
                no fancy features like accounts or comments - but it works great for hosting basic web pages.<br>
                <br>
                Setting up on Github Pages is simple, and there are a million tutorials about it. I just have to put a bunch of HTML files in a folder, and I can just upload it.
                It was really quite simple to get it set up, and in mere minutes I had a website up and running! But, it looked a little something like this:<br>
                
                dnl TODO: Make this width:100% apply to all images of a certain classs

                <img src="blank.png" style="width:100%"> <br>
                <br>
                Yeah, not exactly presentable. 
                <h2 class="sub-header">Step Two: making the actual website</h2><br>
                To make writing HTML code a little easier, it's common to use a build step. In my case, that build step takes the shape of a macro processor.
                A macro processor is something that takes a text file, and processes it. It's almost its own programming language, but instead of code that
                runs step-by-step, it's code that takes a text file (in my case, HTML code) and does a fancy version of find and replace.
                M4 is a macro processor that is widely available, and relatively simple to use. Here is a simplified version of the code used to build this website:
                <pre class="code">
    `define'(`&#96;HEAD'', &#96;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title>$1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="`HOSTSITE'()/style.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
    ') dnl

    `esyscmd'(cat `file')
                </pre>
                Let's dig through what this means, line by line.

                "`define'(&#96;HEAD')" tells m4 to create a macro called "HEAD"
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
